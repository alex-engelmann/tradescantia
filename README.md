# tradescantia

## Overview

The aim of this project was to monitor a plant with a few sensors and alert when readings are outside ideal ranges.  The Tessel 2 board broke down with hardware failures and the project is discontinued.

## The Plant

A *Tradescantia* variety or "Wandering Jew", hence the name of the project.  *Tradescantia* was the name given to the plant genus by Carl Linnaeus, after English naturalist John Tradescant.  You can read more about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradescantia#Etymology).
